RIFT 2026 Hackathon  •  Web3 / Blockchain Open Innovation Track
	Build on Algorand
	Open Innovation Challenge — Powered by Algorand
	Track Overview


This is an open innovation track. You can choose a problem statement from RIFT's curated list College_Hackathon_Project_Ideas_Algorand.docx or propose your own original idea. The only requirement is that your project must meaningfully leverage the Algorand blockchain and use AlgoKit as the primary development toolkit.


Algorand & AlgoKit — What You Must Use


* All smart contracts must be deployed to the Algorand Testnet
* AlgoKit must be used as the primary development framework
* You must provide your App ID (Testnet) at submission
* Your solution must interact with Algorand in a meaningful way — not just as a payment layer


What is AlgoKit?
	✓  AlgoKit is Algorand's official development toolkit for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts
	✓  Documentation and resources available at: https://developer.algorand.org/algokit/
	✓  Use AlgoKit to scaffold your project: algokit init
	

	

Problem Statement Selection


Problem statements for this track will be published on the RIFT website during the official selection window:


Selection Window
19 February 2026  •  6:00 PM – 8:00 PM
Visit the RIFT website to view and select your problem statement
	

Alternatively, you may propose your own original problem and solution, provided it:
* Uses Algorand blockchain meaningfully
* Uses AlgoKit for development and deployment
* Solves a real-world problem
* Demonstrates technical depth and innovation


What to Build


Your project should include a complete, working application. Possible directions include (but are not limited to):
* Decentralized Finance (DeFi) tools — lending, staking, liquidity pools
* NFT platforms — minting, marketplaces, royalties
* DAO governance systems — on-chain voting, proposal management
* Supply chain / provenance tracking
* Identity & credential verification
* Gaming and digital asset platforms
* Carbon credits / sustainability tracking
* Cross-border payments and remittances

Tips for a Strong Submission


What judges love to see:
	✓  A real problem being solved — not just a demo for demo's sake
	✓  Clean, auditable smart contract code with comments
	✓  Smooth UX that hides blockchain complexity from the end user
